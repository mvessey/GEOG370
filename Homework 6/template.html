    <h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth</h1>

    <h3>This map displays the number of individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher in the age group 25 to 34, grouped by County in Maryland. I chose this age group in particular becuase I figured most of those who went straight into college after high school would have graduated with a bachelors degree by the time they are 25. This data shows that most of the states college graduates currently live in counties or around the state's capital or near DC. </h3>
