    <h3>This map uses a percentage of number of indivduals with a bachelor's degree or higher in the age group (25 -34) divided by the total number of participants in this age group. This map is in the categorization: Natural Breaks. This classification type groups values into classes, using an algorithm, separated by distinct break points. This sort of classification categorizes data into classes best when the data is not evenly distributed. A disadvantage of this classification type is that it can result in classes that contain largely varied class ranges. </h3>

    <h3> This map uses a percentage of number of indivduals with a bachelor's degree or higher in the age group (25 -34) divided by the total number of participants in this age group. This map is in the categorization: Quantiles. This classification type puts an equal number of data observations into each section class. This categorization is best put to use for data that has evenly distributed values across its full range. A disadvantage of using this classification is that within a section, the range can be widely enlarged by incredibly different values. This would make it more difficult to easily interpret what values in the range truly represent the counties in that class section. </h3>

    <h3> This map uses a percentage of number of indivduals with a bachelor's degree or higher in the age group (25 -34) divided by the total number of participants in this age group. This map is in the categorization: Equal Intervals. This categorization type divides attribute values into equally sized section classes. This sort of categorization allows the data to be portrayed in an easily interpreted way; however, this categorization may result in a large number of data values being sorted into the same two section classes, with little values being placed into other classes.  </h3>
