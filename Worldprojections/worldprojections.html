    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>You can write a paragraph here</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 projection is a fairly accurate projection. Where it falls short, and where distortions begin to appear are as the latitude moves further and further away from the equator.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has issues with distortion vertically as it moves further away from the prime meridian.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This porjection will accurately display the correct shapes of continents. However, sizes of the continents may become distorted towards the north and south pole.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/mercatorprojection.png">

    </a>
    <h2>Robinson Projection</h2>
    <h3>Overall, this map is fairly accurate, however, its distortions become more and more evident as you move further away from the equator.</h3>

    <img src=".//maps/robinsonmap.png" alt="Robinson" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Winkel l Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection does not show distances accurately. Additionally, vertical distortion can be seen in this projection.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Equal Area Cylindrical Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a cylindrical projection, thus it experiences severe distortion near the poles as the latitude increases and decreases further away from the equator.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/Equal Area Cylindrical  Projection.png">
    <img src=".//maps/Equal Area Cylindrical  Projection.png" alt="Robinson" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a cylindrical projection, thus it experiences severe distortion near the poles as the latitude increases and decreases further away from the equator.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/Equidistant Conic.png">
    <img src=".//maps/Equidistant Conic.png" alt="Robinson" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>This is a cylindrical projection, thus it experiences severe distortion near the poles as the latitude increases and decreases further away from the equator.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant.png">
    <img src=".//maps/North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant.png" alt="Robinson" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2>World Goode Homolosine Land Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a cylindrical projection, thus it experiences severe distortion near the poles as the latitude increases and decreases further away from the equator.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/Goode Projection.png">
    <img src=".//maps/Goode Projection.png" alt="Robinson" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG:  you finished this already.</h3>
