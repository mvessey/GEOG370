    <h1>In this project I learned how to display maps in different projections. </h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>In this homework assignment, we used what we have learned about changing the projection of maps to display a variation of different projections and note their distortions. By changing the display projection, rather than the projection of individual data sources, we were able to change the image of the earth to specific projections while also preserving the original data. To do this, I downloaded the natural earth shapefile to QGIS, looked to the bottom right of QGIS where it says EPSG: 4326, and changed the CRS, or the Coordinate Reference System, to the projections denoted in the instructions. Further, in order to be able to adequately see the projections faults, the Indicatrix mapper, modeled after Tissotâ€™s indicatrix. This allowed me to visualize the distortion present in the different projections.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 projection is a fairly accurate projection. Where it falls short, and where distortions begin to appear are as the latitudes move further and further away from the equator.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection has issues with distortion vertically as it moves further away from the prime meridian. </h3>

    <h2>Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection will accurately display the correct shapes of continents. However, sizes of the continents may become distorted as you move further away from the equator..</h3>

    <h2>Robinson Projection</h2>
    <h3>Overall, this map is fairly accurate, however, its distortions become more and more evident as you move further away from the equator.</h3>

    <h2>Winkel l Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection does not show distances accurately. Additionally, vertical distortion can be seen in this projection.</h3>

    <h2>Equal Area Cylindrical Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a cylindrical projection, thus it experiences severe distortion near the poles as the latitude increases and decreases further away from the equator.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a cylindrical projection, thus it experiences severe distortion near the poles as the latitude increases and decreases further away from the equator. As it is seen clearly in the map below, as you move further away from the north pole more and more distortion is present.</h3>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>This is a cylindrical projection, thus it experiences severe distortion near the poles as the latitude increases and decreases further away from the equator.</h3>

    <h2>World Goode Homolosine Land Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a cylindrical projection, thus it experiences severe distortion near the poles as the latitude increases and decreases further away from the equator.</h3>

    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
