    <p>This map explores the question of where in North Carolina are coyote territories, based on reported coyote sightings and the typical distance of coyote territory. Do to this I had to use intersect() to isolate the dataset on coyote sightings to only sightings in North Carolina with a NC counties shapefile. Then in order to determine where territories may be, I had to add a 2.2 mile buffer around each point.</p>
